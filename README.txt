Acceleration Structure:
 We did not have time to implement an accelration structure.


Files:
The test images that were submitted to edX are containted in folder "submitPictures".
All the source files are in HW4 folder.
The source files are:
  readfile.h
  readfile.cpp
  Transform.h
  Transform.cpp
  variables.h
  HW4.cpp  


IMPORTANT NOTES ON RUNNING THE CODE:
  In this zip file I have included my program in executable form, inside of the
Release folder. The executable must be run inside that folder, becasue it needs
accsses to the FreeImage library files.
  If you wish to compile this project for yourself, I would recomend compiling it 
for release x86, as release optimizes the code greatly. I compiled the code using 
Microsoft Visual Studios 2017.

NOTES:
  Because we didn't implement an acceleration structure, scene 7 takes 1 hour 30 mins to 
finish.
